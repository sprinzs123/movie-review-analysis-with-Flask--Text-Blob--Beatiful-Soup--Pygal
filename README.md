# movie-review-analysis-with-Flask--Text-Blob--Beatiful-Soup--Pygal
This app relies to TextBlob library for text sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis gives number on how positive/negative and subjective/objective text is.
This analysis can get general 'feel' of the text.

BeautifulSoup library was used to scrape all critics movie reviews from rotten tommatoes. 
All reviews were analyzing using TextBlob library, and they were ranked on their subjectivity and polatiry.

I choose to display to 3 of most extreme rated reviews
Additionlly, I used pygal library in order to create interactive bar graph with all reviews.
Suprisingly, no matter of movie I choose, the distirbution of reviews was normal distirbution.
